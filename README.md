# mapguide-mvc-sample

The Sheboygan .net viewer sample ported over to ASP.net MVC

This is a work in progress and does not represent all of the existing .net code samples out there.

# Requirements

 * MapGuide Open Source 2.6 (64-bit)
 * Visual Studio 2013 Community or higher

All other requirements will be pulled down via NuGet when you open/build the solution for the first time

# Notes

This sample project will create and run on a local IIS virtual directory, so you will generally need to run Visual Studio as an administrator.
